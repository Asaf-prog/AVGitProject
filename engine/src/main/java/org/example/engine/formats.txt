////////////////////////////-Create a new commit-///////////////////////

we get from the user the current path
we have the ability to create a new commit because the file changes
in addition we have the last Header file, so we have the commit that we create from,
and then we create a head file that point on the root directory
we will get the exact file how changes and start is recursion create their blob and tree
=> The head file point on the root directory, and point on the commit File  which will contain the sh1 of the last file
